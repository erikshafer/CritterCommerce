# 🪄 Ecommerce with the Critter Stack 🛒

Also known as **CritterCommerce**. This is a collection of use cases leveraging the __Critter Stack__, which consists of [Wolverine](https://wolverinefx.io/) + [Marten](https://martendb.io/) + [others](https://github.com/jasperfx).

Our aim with this repository is to demonstrate concepts such as event-driven architecture, event sourcing, vertical-slice modules, and other concepts that can accelerate your .NET software development while making it more robust than conventional frameworks and libraries you may be used to.

## 🚧 Work In Progress

This is a WIP.
